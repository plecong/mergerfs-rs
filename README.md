# mergerfs-rs

**‚ö†Ô∏è EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION ‚ö†Ô∏è**

This is an experimental Rust implementation of [mergerfs](https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs), a union filesystem that combines multiple directories into a single mount point.

## üöß Project Status

This project is **highly experimental** and **incomplete**. It should **NOT** be used for any production workloads or important data. The implementation is approximately 43% complete compared to the original C++ mergerfs.

## ü§ñ About This Repository

This repository is an experiment in AI-assisted software development using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). The entire codebase has been developed through collaboration with Claude, Anthropic's AI assistant, to explore:

- How effectively AI can understand and implement complex system software
- The feasibility of porting a mature C++ project to Rust with AI assistance
- Best practices for AI-driven development of low-level filesystem code

## What is mergerfs?

mergerfs is a union filesystem that allows you to combine multiple directories (branches) into a single mount point. It's commonly used for:
- Combining multiple drives into a single logical volume
- Creating storage pools without RAID
- Implementing tiered storage solutions

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Implemented Features
- Basic FUSE filesystem operations (read, write, create, delete)
- Directory operations and metadata management
- Multiple file distribution policies (ff, mfs, lfs, rand, epff, epmfs, eplfs, pfrd)
- Extended attributes (xattr) support
- Symbolic and hard link support
- Runtime configuration via xattr
- Path preservation for existing path policies
- moveonenospc (automatic file migration on out-of-space errors)

### ‚ùå Not Implemented
- Many advanced policies
- File locking
- Advanced I/O operations (fallocate, copy_file_range)
- Performance optimizations and caching
- Many other features (see IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md for details)

## Development Approach

This project follows these principles:
1. **No unsafe Rust code** - All implementations use safe Rust
2. **Alpine Linux/MUSL compatible** - Avoids glibc dependencies
3. **Policy-driven design** - Flexible branch selection algorithms
4. **Comprehensive testing** - Unit tests and Python-based integration tests
5. **AI-documented** - Code and design decisions documented by Claude

## Building and Testing

**‚ö†Ô∏è Remember: This is experimental software and should not be used with important data!**

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run Python integration tests
cd python_tests
uv sync
uv run pytest
```

## Usage Example (Experimental Only!)

```bash
# DO NOT USE WITH IMPORTANT DATA
./target/release/mergerfs-rs -o func.create=mfs /mnt/union /mnt/disk1 /mnt/disk2
```

## Contributing

As this is an experiment in AI-assisted development, contributions should align with the experimental nature of the project. See CLAUDE.md for guidelines on working with Claude Code.

## License

This project follows the same license as the original mergerfs project.
