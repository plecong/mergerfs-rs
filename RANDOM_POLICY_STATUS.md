# Random Policy Implementation Status

## Completed Work

### 1. Random Policy Implementation
- ✅ Implemented `RandomCreatePolicy` in `src/policy/create/random.rs`
- ✅ Added filesystem permission checking (not just branch mode)
- ✅ Returns appropriate errors (EROFS when all branches are read-only)
- ✅ Integrated with main binary (accessible via `-o func.create=rand`)

### 2. FUSE Write Fixes
- ✅ Fixed FUSE write implementation to support arbitrary offsets
- ✅ Separated file creation from file writing operations
- ✅ Added proper `write_to_file` and `truncate_file` methods
- ✅ Fixed issue where writes were incorrectly deleting existing files

### 3. Documentation
- ✅ Created detailed C++ implementation analysis in `docs/policies/create/random-cpp-implementation.md`
- ✅ Updated main policy documentation with random policy details
- ✅ Documented the two-stage approach and error priority system

### 4. Tests Passing
- ✅ `test_random_policy_basic` - Basic random distribution works
- ✅ `test_random_policy_distribution` - Files distributed across branches  
- ✅ `test_random_policy_error_handling` - Returns EROFS when all branches read-only
- ✅ `test_random_policy_directory_creation` - Directories created randomly

## Remaining Issues

### Test Failures
1. **test_random_policy_readonly_branches** - Files not created when some branches are read-only
   - Expected: Should use writable branches when some are read-only
   - Actual: No files being created

2. **test_random_policy_single_branch** - File not found in the only branch
   - Expected: File should be in the single branch
   - Actual: File not found

3. **test_random_policy_vs_firstfound** - Mount point issues
   - Stale mount points causing connection errors

## Key Implementation Differences from C++

1. **Free Space Checking**: Our implementation doesn't yet check minimum free space
2. **Error Priority**: We implemented filesystem permission checking but may need to refine error handling
3. **Branch Detection**: We detect actual filesystem permissions, not just branch modes

## Next Steps (if continuing)

1. Debug why files aren't appearing in branches for some tests
2. Add minimum free space checking to match C++ behavior
3. Investigate timing/sync issues with file creation
4. Consider implementing the "all" policy to match C++ two-stage approach
