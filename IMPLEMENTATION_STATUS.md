# mergerfs-rs Implementation Status

This document tracks the overall implementation progress of mergerfs-rs, a Rust implementation of the mergerfs union filesystem.

## Project Overview

mergerfs-rs aims to be a complete, compatible implementation of mergerfs in Rust, providing:
- Union filesystem functionality combining multiple branches
- Policy-driven file placement and access
- FUSE-based transparent filesystem interface
- Alpine Linux/MUSL compatibility
- Memory-safe implementation without unsafe code

## Overall Progress

- **FUSE Operations**: 24 of 40+ implemented (60%)
- **Policies**: 11 of 36 implemented (31%)
- **Special Features**: 3 of 10+ fully implemented (30%)
- **Test Coverage**: 
  - Rust tests: 174 passing
  - Python tests: 
    - Passing: ~120 tests across action policies, MFS, rename, search, etc.
    - Skipped: 6 test files (~60 tests) due to missing features:
      - `test_hard_links.py` - FUSE link() not implemented
      - `test_special_files.py` - FUSE mknod() not implemented
      - `test_runtime_config.py` - Control file xattr interface not working
      - `test_branch_modes.py` - RO/NC modes not enforced
      - `test_existing_path_policies.py` - Runtime policy switching not implemented
      - `test_moveonenospc.py` - Timeout issues with large file operations
    - Issues: 3 test files with stability problems:
      - `test_file_handles_property.py` - Property test timeouts
      - `test_property_based.py` - Flaky property tests
      - Some search policy tests fail on symlink operations
- **Known Limitations**: 
  - Concurrent operations limited by FUSE protocol
  - Several features partially implemented but not fully working

## Known Issues

2. **Error Aggregation**: Simple error handling compared to C++ version
3. **Memory Usage**: No memory pooling or optimization
4. **Compatibility**: Some edge cases may differ from C++ mergerfs
5. **Missing FUSE Operations**: 
   - `link` operation not implemented (causes hard link test failures)
   - `mknod` operation not implemented (causes special file test failures)
6. **Incomplete Features**:
   - Branch modes (RO/NC) not enforced in FUSE operations
   - Runtime policy configuration via .mergerfs control file not working
   - Existing path policies not switchable at runtime
7. **Test Failures**: 
   - Hard link tests fail with "Operation not permitted"
   - Special file tests fail with "Function not implemented"
   - Runtime config tests fail - control file xattr operations not working
   - Branch mode tests skipped - modes not enforced
   - Existing path policy tests skipped - runtime switching not available

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features
1. **Study C++ implementation**: Review original mergerfs code
2. **Document design**: Create design doc in `docs/`
3. **Implement in Rust**: Follow existing patterns, no unsafe code
4. **Add tracing**: Include comprehensive tracing spans for debugging
5. **Write unit tests**: Comprehensive test coverage
6. **Add integration tests**: Python tests using trace-based framework
7. **Update this status**: Keep implementation status current

### Code Standards
- No unsafe code
- Proper error handling with errno mapping
- Thread-safe implementations using Arc/RwLock
- Policy-driven design for flexibility
- Alpine Linux/MUSL compatibility
- Comprehensive tracing for all operations

### Testing Standards
- Use trace-based testing infrastructure for reliability
- Replace sleep() with intelligent wait functions
- Enable FUSE_TRACE=1 for all test runs
- Monitor operation completion instead of arbitrary delays

## Implementation Details

### Space Calculation
- Uses `f_bavail` (blocks available to unprivileged users) instead of `f_bfree` for space calculations
- This matches the C++ mergerfs behavior and respects filesystem reservations
- Implemented using the `nix` crate for portable `statvfs` support
- See `docs/SPACE_CALCULATION.md` for detailed information

### Symlink Handling
- Uses `symlink_metadata()` instead of `metadata()` to preserve symlink attributes
- Properly detects and reports symlinks as `FileType::Symlink` in FUSE operations
- Matches C++ implementation's default behavior (follow_symlinks=NEVER)

### Access Operation
- Implements POSIX-compliant permission checking
- Supports F_OK, R_OK, W_OK, X_OK access modes
- Manual permission bit checking without libc dependency
- See `docs/ACCESS_OPERATION_DESIGN.md` for implementation details

### Directory Handle Management
- Implements proper opendir/releasedir operations with handle tracking
- Directory handles maintain path context between operations
- Compatible with clients that may not use opendir before readdir
- Thread-safe handle storage using parking_lot RwLock
- See `docs/OPENDIR_RELEASEDIR_DESIGN.md` for implementation details

### MoveOnENOSPC Feature
- Automatically moves files to another branch when write fails with ENOSPC/EDQUOT
- Configurable via xattr with support for any create policy
- Preserves file handles and attributes during migration
- Default policy is PFRD (Proportional Fill Random Distribution)
- See `docs/MOVEONENOSPC_DESIGN.md` for implementation details

### Fallocate Operation
- Implements file preallocation for improved performance
- Supports basic allocation (mode=0) and KEEP_SIZE flag
- Cross-platform implementation with fallback for non-Linux systems
- Simplified implementation using standard file operations
- See `docs/FALLOCATE_DESIGN.md` for implementation details

### Direct I/O Support
- Implements cache.files configuration option with multiple caching modes
- Supports libfuse, off (direct I/O), partial, full, auto-full, and per-process modes
- Sets FOPEN_DIRECT_IO flag appropriately on open/create operations
- Configurable at runtime via xattr interface
- See `docs/DIRECT_IO_DESIGN.md` and `docs/DIRECT_IO_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for details

## Known Limitations

### Concurrent Operations
- FUSE protocol serializes all filesystem requests through a single kernel-userspace channel
- Multiple threads/processes attempting concurrent file operations will experience blocking
- This is a fundamental limitation of FUSE, not specific to mergerfs-rs
- Concurrent Python tests are skipped due to this limitation
- See `docs/MULTI_THREADED_FUSE_DESIGN.md` for detailed analysis

### Performance Considerations
- Single-threaded request processing may limit throughput on multi-core systems
- Large directory operations can block other filesystem operations
- No support for kernel-level caching optimizations

## Resources

- **Documentation**: See `docs/` directory for detailed design docs
- **Original Code**: `refs/mergerfs-original/` contains C++ implementation
- **Python Tests**: `python_tests/` for integration testing
- **Examples**: See existing implementations for patterns

## Next Steps

1. **High Priority (Fix Test Failures)**:

   - **Implement FUSE `mknod` operation** for special file support
     - Backend implementation exists in `src/special_files.rs`
     - Need to add `mknod` handler in `src/fuse_fs.rs`
     - Unskip `tests/test_special_files.py` when complete
   
   - **Complete runtime configuration** via .mergerfs control file
     - Control file exists but xattr get/set operations return errors

   - **Implement branch mode enforcement** (RO/NC)
     - Branch modes parsed but not enforced in FUSE operations
     - Need to check branch mode in create/write operations
     - Unskip `tests/test_branch_modes.py` when complete
   
   - **Enable runtime policy switching**

   - Implement most shared path policies (msp* variants)
   - Add ftruncate operation support
   - Implement file locking (lock, flock)

4. **Low Priority (Performance)**:
