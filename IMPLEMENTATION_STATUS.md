## Known Issues

1. **Performance**: No caching or optimization implemented
2. **Error Aggregation**: Simple error handling compared to C++ version
3. **Memory Usage**: No memory pooling or optimization
4. **Compatibility**: Some edge cases may differ from C++ mergerfs

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features
1. **Study C++ implementation**: Review original mergerfs code
2. **Document design**: Create design doc in `docs/`
3. **Implement in Rust**: Follow existing patterns, no unsafe code
4. **Add tracing**: Include comprehensive tracing spans for debugging
5. **Write unit tests**: Comprehensive test coverage
6. **Add integration tests**: Python tests using trace-based framework
7. **Update this status**: Keep implementation status current

### Code Standards
- No unsafe code
- Proper error handling with errno mapping
- Thread-safe implementations using Arc/RwLock
- Policy-driven design for flexibility
- Alpine Linux/MUSL compatibility
- Comprehensive tracing for all operations

### Testing Standards
- Use trace-based testing infrastructure for reliability
- Replace sleep() with intelligent wait functions
- Enable FUSE_TRACE=1 for all test runs
- Monitor operation completion instead of arbitrary delays

## Implementation Details

### Space Calculation
- Uses `f_bavail` (blocks available to unprivileged users) instead of `f_bfree` for space calculations
- This matches the C++ mergerfs behavior and respects filesystem reservations
- Implemented using the `nix` crate for portable `statvfs` support
- See `docs/SPACE_CALCULATION.md` for detailed information

### Symlink Handling
- Uses `symlink_metadata()` instead of `metadata()` to preserve symlink attributes
- Properly detects and reports symlinks as `FileType::Symlink` in FUSE operations
- Matches C++ implementation's default behavior (follow_symlinks=NEVER)

### Access Operation
- Implements POSIX-compliant permission checking
- Supports F_OK, R_OK, W_OK, X_OK access modes
- Manual permission bit checking without libc dependency
- See `docs/ACCESS_OPERATION_DESIGN.md` for implementation details

### Directory Handle Management
- Implements proper opendir/releasedir operations with handle tracking
- Directory handles maintain path context between operations
- Compatible with clients that may not use opendir before readdir
- Thread-safe handle storage using parking_lot RwLock
- See `docs/OPENDIR_RELEASEDIR_DESIGN.md` for implementation details

### MoveOnENOSPC Feature
- Automatically moves files to another branch when write fails with ENOSPC/EDQUOT
- Configurable via xattr with support for any create policy
- Preserves file handles and attributes during migration
- Default policy is PFRD (Proportional Fill Random Distribution)
- See `docs/MOVEONENOSPC_DESIGN.md` for implementation details

## Resources

- **Documentation**: See `docs/` directory for detailed design docs
- **Original Code**: `refs/mergerfs-original/` contains C++ implementation
- **Python Tests**: `python_tests/` for integration testing
- **Examples**: See existing implementations for patterns

## Next Steps

1. Implement lus (least used space) create policy
2. Implement path preservation for remaining "existing path" policies
3. Add fallocate support for preallocation
4. Implement fsyncdir for directory synchronization
5. Add direct I/O support
